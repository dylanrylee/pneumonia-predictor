# Pneumonia Xray Detector

A convolutional neural network (CNN)â€“based classifier that analyzes chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia, with built-in Grad-CAM explainability and a Streamlit web interface for interactive testing.

- Developed a CNN with Batch Normalization and Dropout to classify chest X-rays and reduce overfitting.
- Applied Grad-CAM to visualize activation regions, improving model interpretability for pneumonia diagnosis.
- Built and deployed a Streamlit app to process user-uploaded X-rays and return predictions with confidence scores. 
- Achieved ~90% test accuracy by training on preprocessed data with early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
